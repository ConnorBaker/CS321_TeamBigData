# System Overview

> Provide a high-level overview of the system. This is the product vision
and should be stated in the users' vernacular.

The Team Big Data (TBD) Analytics Package performs sentiment analysis of
tweets. The sentiment analysis of a user's tweet is a group of numbers
which can be thought of as representing the user's net emotional state
(negative/neutral/positive). This information can be used to more
effectively target a user with advertisements or gain insights to their
desires.

Take your marketing to the next level with the TBD Analytics Package.

# Rationale for Building

> Outline the problem, the motivation for building such a product, and
your solution approach. Also, if there are other alternatives to your
product in the market, discuss the unique characteristics of your
solution and the shortcomings of the existing products.

## Problem and Motivation

Facebook and Google, the "F" and "G" of FANG, are two of the market's
four best-performing tech stocks. Facebook and Google's primary sources
of revenue comes from selling ads through their respective platforms.
Part of why Facebook and Google have excelled where their competitors
have stalled is their ability to acquire information about their users.
With every post, click, or search, users of these platforms tell the
monolithic companies behind them things about themselves. This
information is sold to a third party or used by the company to increase
the effectiveness of targeted advertisements.

Companies like Facebook and Google have a monopolistic control of their
platform -- they decide what information to share about their users and
the prices to charge for that information. In part due to this
monopolistic control, information has become a market. Numerous
companies have sprung up in this "information market", each purporting
to deliver analytics packages to businesses which would perform miracles
like doubling their marketing reach or tripling their click-through
rate. These offerings are particularly enticing to businesses without
the fortune of controlling a platform which passively aggregates their
target market's information. However, many of the benefits these
companies offer never materialize.

## Solution

Team Big Data (TBD) seeks to fill a perceived gap in the market. Most
companies lack a platform which passively aggregates information about
their target market (Ã  la Google and Facebook). These companies stand to
benefit from analytics about the demographics they hope to reach with
their advertisements.

TBD's Analytics Package uses semantics analysis in a novel way to
provide relevant and actionable information ranging from specific
members of a target market to well the market as a whole.

# Methodology Used

> Describe the process by which you gathered, analyzed, and validated the
requirements for the system under consideration. Briefly discuss the
criteria used for evaluating the requirements.

Following the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) our team began the semester
on a Program Increment Planning (IP) event which lasts for the duration
of a single sprint.

During the IP, our team met with Dr. Soundararajan to run through a mock
Program Increment event. Dr. Soundararajan and our team's System
Architect, Connor, acted as the customer and described features that
they would like the system to have. This conversation between the
customer and the developers ensured that both are on the same page and
that no infeasible requirements were left on the table. The team took
those features and began to break them down into user stories so that
they could be more accurately estimated.

With a backlog full of user stories, the team prioritized features by
using Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) to enable higher velocity and
an increased likelihood of producing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

> Provide a prioritized and approximately estimated list of functional
requirements for the system. Describe each requirement briefly and state
the rationale for including that requirement. Also, discuss the
prioritization and estimation schemes used.

### Fetch data from Twitter

Twitter is the main source of information that our analytics package
draws from. As such, we need to be able to fetch data from Twitter.

#### Dependencies

No dependencies.

#### Priority

This requirement has an extremely high priority because all the other
priorities depend on it.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about two weeks due to our team's low velocity.
This estimation was derived from prior experience.

### Extract meaningful content from Twitter

The data that Twitter returns is too verbose for the purposes of our
analytics package. Since processing, storing, and analyzing data
requires energy and money, we should aim to do as little of these things
as possible. Therefore, it is necessary to extract only meaningful
information from what Twitter returns.

#### Dependencies

-   Fetch data from Twitter

#### Priority

This requirement has a medium priority as it serves only to help TBD
minimize the utilization of its pipeline and avoid retaining potentially
sensitive information.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about two weeks due to our team's low velocity.
This estimation was derived from prior experience.

### Enrich content from Twitter with sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis is the cornerstone of the proposed analytics package.
As such, we must ensure that our pipeline can perform that analysis.

#### Dependencies

-   Fetch data from Twitter

#### Priority

This requirement has an extremely high priority so that we can enable
analytics and visualizations.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about two weeks due to our team's low velocity.
This estimation was derived from prior experience.

### Load enriched content into a data store

Excluding streaming analytics, data must be at rest to be analyzed. As
such, our pipeline must have the ability to load data into a data store.

#### Dependencies

-   Fetch data from Twitter

-   Enrich content from Twitter with sentiment analysis

#### Priority

This requirement has an extremely high priority as it enables analytics
and visualizations.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about one week due to our team's low velocity. This
estimation was derived from prior experience.

### Load data into multiple data stores

To avoid vendor-lock in and promote the health of the product, our
pipeline should be able to ingest into several different data stores.

#### Dependencies

No dependencies.

#### Priority

This requirement has a medium priority as it only serves to prevent
vendor lock-in.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about one week due to our team's low velocity. This
estimation was derived from prior experience.

### Provide relevant analytics on the ingested information

The proposed package should provide meaningful analytics which analyze
not only a user's emotional sentiment at a single instance in time but
also some arbitrary span of time.

#### Dependencies

-   Fetch data from Twitter

-   Enrich content from Twitter with sentiment analysis

#### Priority

This requirement has an extremely high priority as it provides the
analytics component of the TBD Analytics Package.

#### Estimate

The time estimate is about two weeks due to our team's low velocity.
This estimation was derived from prior experience.

## Non-Functional Requirements

> Identify the non-functional requirements for the system. Include the
measurement criteria for each of the non- functional requirements.
Record any constraints that these requirements may place on the system
to be built.

### Scalable system

A scalable system is one which can run on many different threads on a
single machine. A scalable system is a necessary for non-trivial
big-data packages.

#### Metric

System has the capability to scale across multiple threads.

### Distributed system

A distributed system is one which can run on many different machines. A
distributed system is a necessary for non-trivial big-data packages: it
is not usually possible to "scale up" a machine (that is, make it more
powerful), however, it is usually trivial to "scale out" an application
to more machines.

#### Metric

System has the capability to scale across multiple machines.

### Guaranteed Delivery

The quality of an analytics package is dependent upon the quality of the
data it analyzes. Guaranteed Delivery ensures that all the data that
enters the pipeline is eventually ingested into a data store, removing
the possibility that data is lost along the way.

#### Metric

Data Flow Pipeline provides Guaranteed Delivery.

# Use Case Descriptions

> Identify four use cases and develop a use case description for each by
applying the use case template. Each use case description must include a
description of the main sequence of interactions between the actor(s)
and the system, as well as description of the alternative sequences.

# Contributions

> Include information about the following: 1) the name of the person who
managed the work for this deliverable and 2) individual contributions.

Connor managed the work for this deliverable.

Connor worked as the System Architect to answer questions the team had
and acted as the customer to help deliver to the team a list of desired
features. He made himself available for Q&A with the rest of the team as
they created requirements and use cases.

Ghousia, Shin, and Ziyan held a mock Increment Planning event with
Connor and Dr. Soundararajan acting as the customer to begin making
notes of desired features, allowing them to formalize requirements. They
also created the different use-cases. In addition, they did work outside
of this deliverable to get up to speed with a technology critical to the
TBD Analytics Package, producing two artifacts as they did so.
